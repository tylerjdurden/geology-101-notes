## Minerals

* Minerals: building blocks of rock
	* Definition of a mineral
		* Naturally occurring inorganic solid
		* Ordered internal molecular structure
		* Definite chemical composition
	* Definition of a rock
		* A solid aggregate of minerals

* Bonding
	* Ionic bonding
	* Covalent bonding
		* Atoms share electrons to achieve electrical neutrality
		* Generally stronger than ionic bonds

* Polymorphs
	* Minerals with the same composition but different crystalline structures
	* Examples include diamond and graphite
		* **Phase change** - one polymorph changing into another

* Process
	* When atoms of a mineral (chemical compound) are arranged in a different configuration, they give that mineral different physical properties

* Rock-forming minerals
	* Common minerals that make up most of the rocks of Earth's crust
	* Although nearly 5000 have been named, only a few dozen are common
	* Composed mainly of the 8 elements (O, Si, metals) that compose over 98% of the continental crust
		* Most rock you see is made of silicon, oxygen, and metals

* Silicates
	* Most important mineral group
		* Comprise most rock-forming minerals
		* Very abundant due to large % of silicon and oxygen in Earth's crust
	* Silicon-oxygen tetrahedron
		* Fundamental building block
		* Four oxygen ions surrounding much smaller silicon ion

* Mineral groups
	* Single tetrahedra are linked together to form several silicate structures, including
		* Isolated tetrahedra
		* Ring structures
		* Single and double chains
		* Sheet or layered structures
		* Complex 3-dimensional structures
	* Common silicate minerals
		* Feldspar group (most common)
			* Exhibit two directions of perfect cleavage at 90 degrees
			* Orthoclase (potassium feldspar) and Plagioclas (sodium and calcium feldspar) are the two most common members
		* Light silicates: Quartz
			* Only common silicate composed entirely of oxygen and silicon
			* Hard and resistant to weathering
			* Conchoidal fracture
			* Often forms hexagonal crystals
	* Muscovite: common member of the mica group
		* Excellent cleavage in one direction
		* Produces the "glimmering" brilliance often seen in beach sand
	* Dark silicates: Olivine group
		* High temperature Fe-Mg silicates
		* Individual tetrahedra linked together by iron and magnesium ions
		* Forms small, rounded crystals with no cleavage
	* Dark silicates: Pyroxene group
		* Single chain structures with iron and magnesium
		* Two distinctive cleavages at nearly 90 degrees
		* Augite is the most common mineral in the pyroxene group
	* Dark silicates: Amphibole group
		* Double chain structures
		* Two perfect cleavages exhibiting angles of 124 and 56 degrees
		* Hornblende is the most common mineral in the amphibole group
	* Nonsilicate ores and industrial minerals
		* Carbonates
			* Form limestone and dolostone rock
			* Calcite (CaCO<sub>3</sub>) and dolomite CaMg(CO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> are the two most important carbonate materials
		* Oxides
			* Hematite (oxide mined for iron ore)
		* Sulfides
			* Sphalerite (sulfide mined for zinc ore)
		* Others
			* Halite (halide mined for salt)
			* Native copper (native element mined for copper)

* Mining metal ores
	* Copper mine (open pit)
		* Copper oxides near top
		* Copper sulfides at depth
	* Iron mine (open pit)
		* Iron oxides layered deposit - deposited as layers

* Mineral deposits
	* Ore deposits form int late stages of igneous intrustions, from metal-enriched fluids
