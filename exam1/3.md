## Plate Tectonics
#### The basic paradigm for understanding changes in the Earth's interior

* Earth's major plates
	* Seven major lithospheric plates
	* Largest is Pacific plate
	* Some plates include a continent block plus a large area of seafloor
	* Plates are in motion and continually changing in shape and size
	* Plates move at a very slowly but continuous rate
		* About 5cm per year
		* Cooler, denser slabs of oceanic lithosphere descend into lower parts of the mantle

* Composition of Earth plates
	* Crustal plates contain ocean crust and continental crust
	* Ocean crust continually made at spreading axes
	* Continental crust is 'permanent' and carried along in plate, moving across Earth surface by plate motion
		* Like a log floating in ocean water and carried by ocean currents

* Process
	* Plate tectonics is the movement of the outer zone of the Earth due to convective movement of heated rock in the Earth interior

* Continental drift
	* Continental drift hypothesis first proposed by Alfred Wegener in 1915
		* An idea before its time
		* Continents "drifted" to present positions
	* Evidence used in support of continental drift hypothesis
		* Fit of the Atlantic continents
		* Rock type and structural similarities
		* Fossil evidence
		* Paleoclimatic evidence

* The great debate
	* Objections to the continental drift hypothesis
		* Lack of a mechanism for moving continents
		* Wegener incorrectly suggested that continents pushed through the ocean crust, much like ice breakers cut through ice
		* Strong opposition to the hypothesis
	* Continental drift and the scientific method
		* Wegener's hypothesis was correct in general, but wrong in mechanism and details
		* *Could not be proven; failed available tests*

* The nature of scientific inquiry
	* How or why things happen is explained using a: 
		* **Hypothesis** - a tentative (or untested) explanation
		* **Theory** - a well-tested and widely accepted view that the scientific community agrees best explains certain observable facts
		* **Testing** - the hypothesis/theory and modifying or discarding if it fails test

* Continental drift and paleomagnetism
	* Seafloor spreading hypothesis proposed in early 1960s
	* Ocean crust record of geomagnetic reversals
		* Earth's magnetic field periodically reverses polarity -- the north magnetic pole becomes the south magnetic pole, and vice versa
		* Geomagnetic reversals are recorded in the ocean crust
			* Dates when the polarity of Earth's magnetism changed determined from lava flows
		* In 1963 Vine and Matthews tied the discovery of magnetic stripes in the ocean crust near ridges to Hess's concept of seafloor spreading

* Rock magnetism
	* Magnetized minerals in rocks
		* Show the direction to Earth's magnetic poles *when they are magnetized*
		* Provide a means of determining their latitude of origin

* Process
	* Rocks and minerals with metal atoms (e.g Fe) capture a bit of the Earth's magnetic field when they form 
	* Magenetic record lost if they are deformed or melt

* Paleomagnetic reversals in ocean crust
	* Provides the most convincing evidence to support the concepts of continental drift and seafloor spreading -- both the direction and rate of seafloor spreading can be established
