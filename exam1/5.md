## Continental Rifting

* Rifting leads to development of a spreading axis.
* Convergent plate boundaries
	* Older portions of oceanic plates are returned to the mantle in these destructive plate margins
	* Surface expression of the descending plate is an ocean trench
	* Also called subduction zones
	* Average angle of subduction = 45 degrees

* Angle of subduction
	* Oceanic lithosphere subducts because its ocerall density is greater than the underlying mantle
	* Subduction of older, colder lithosphere descends at a steep angle
	* Younger, warmer oceanic lithosphere is mmore buoyant and angles of descent are smaller

* Convergent plate boundaries
	* Ocean-continental convergence
		* Denser oceanic slab sinks into the asthenosphere
		* Along the descending plate partial melting of mantle rock generates magma
		* Resulting volcanic mountain chain is called a continental volcanic arc (Andes and Cascades)
	* Volcanic lava is less dense than oceanic rock because of mixing

* Ocean-ocean crust convergence
	* When two oceanic slabs converge, one descends beneath the other
	* Often forms volcanoes on the ocean floor
	* If the volcanoes emerge as islands, a volcanic island arc is formed (Japan, Aleutian islands, Tonga islands)
	* Volcanic lava is more dense than continental margin lava

* Continent-continent convergence
	* When continental blocks converge, the continental crust collides and thickens, producing high mountain range
	* Forms high-standing foldbelt mountain ranges, like Himalayas, Alps, Appalachians
	* The uppermost mantle part of lithosphere subducts and drops lower into mantle (is denser and sinks)
	* String but internal deformation, but less volcanism

* Transform faults
	* Short transform faults common along spreading axes in ocean basins
