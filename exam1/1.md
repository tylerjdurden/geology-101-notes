###Earth History

* Geological history divided into hierarchy of units

	* Eon - major unit of time scale
	* Era - subdivision of an eon
	* Period - subdivision of an era
	* Epoch - subdivision of a period

	* Phanerozoic ("visible life") - the most recent eon, began about 540 million years ago
	* Precambrian - nearly 4 billion years prior to Cabrian period

* Gaseous Shell Lost
	* Original gases of Earth lost by solar blasting
	* Result in loss of: 
		* Neon
		* Argon
		* Krypton
		* Xenon
	* Replacement atmosphere formed by volcanic emissions (N2, CO2, H2O, SO2, HCl)
	* Liquid water is a unique feature of earth. Cool enough for water vapor to condense, form oceans
	* Those acids? SO2 and HCl? They dissolved in water and reacted with exposed rock (weathering). Result is similar water to modern oceans.

* Zonal Structure Of Earth
	* Initial heating of Earth to 2000 deg C
	* Earth melted - volatiles lost (degassing)
	* Melting and separation of immiscible materials
	* Iron and nickel sunk to center to form core
	* Ca, K, and Na compounds floated to top to form crust (also much O, Si, Al, U)
	* Residual Fe and Mg silicates and metal oxides form mantle
	* Layers, from outer to inner
		* Crust, 5-70km
		* Mantle, 2900km
			* Lithosphere, 5-250km, brittle
			* Asthenosphere, 660km, weak plastic (partly melted)
			* Mesosphere, 2240km, strong plastic
		* Core, 3486 km
			* Outer core, 2270km
			* Inner core, 1216km

* Formation Of Core
	* Dominant event of early Earth
	* Forms within 30 million years of Earth origin
	* Smelting of iron from rocky solids releases liquid iron (releases enough heat to melt planet)
	* Most metals went from mantle to center of earth

* Continental Crust And Crustal Evolution
	* Melting of planets 4.5-4.4 b.y.
	* Lithosphere forms by 4.4 b.y., with *water-laden* surface (no magma oceans)
	* Forms continental crust of diorite and granite
	* Plate tectonic movement begins
	* Mantle plumes active (meaning?)

* Ancient Earth 
	* First billion years, 4.5-3.5 b.y.
		* Formation of continents and ocean basins
		* Very active volcanoes, tectonic plates
		* Volcanic emissions produce atmosphere
		* Life appears (!)
	* Domination of microbial life, 3.5-1.0 b.y.
		* Earth surface has abundant microbial life
		* Release oxygen (O2) to atmosphere (~2.5 b.y.)
		* Deposition of iron-rich sediments in ocean
		* Plate tectonics and continental drift
	* Oxygenation Event, 2.5-2.0 b.y.
		* Deposition of iron-rich sediments in ocean
	* Last 1 billion years
		* Appearance of multicelled life
		* Oxygen-rich atmosphere
		* Large lifeforms colonize land
		* Hothouse and Icehouse climate cycles

* Carboniferous Swamp
* Age of Dinosaurs
* Relative age relationship: superposition of layered rocks
	* Can determine older vs. younger, but not numerical ages
	* Superposition of fossil species
		* In an undeformed sequence of sedimentary rocks, the oldest rocks are on the bottom
		* Fossil - traces or remains of life now preserved in sedimentary rock
		* Changes in fossil assemblages used to subdivide geologic time
