## Plate Tectonics, cont'd

* Forces driving plate motions
	* Convective flow in the mantle is the basic driving force of plate tectonics
	* Forces that drive plate motion: slab-pull and ridge-push

* What drives plate motions
	* Models of plate-mantle convection
		* Whole-mantle convection
		* Upper mantle model
			* Layering at 660 km
		* Deep-layer model

* Heat engine for the Earth
	* 2. radioactive decay - lesser heat source
	* 1. Iron crystallization of inner core - primary source
		* Crystallization of iron in the inner fcore occurs over time. This process takes liquid iron from a more energetic to less energetic solid condition and releases heat.

* Documenting the plate tectonics model
	* Hot spots and mantle plumes
		* Caused by rising lpumes of mantle material
		* Volcanoes can form over them (Hawaiian Island chain)
	* Mantle plumes
		* Long-lived structures
		* Some originate at great depth, perhaps at the mantle-core boundary

* Process
	* Mantle plumes are large columns of superheated mantle rock that rise toward the surface but remain nearly fixed in position (are not part of plate convection)

* Documenting the plate tectonics model, cont'd
	* Evidence supporting plate tectonic model:
		* Paleomagnetic patterns in ocean crust
		* Ocean drilling shows sediment cover thickens away from ridge and age of deepest sediment increases farther from spreading axis

* Plate motion and subsiding ocean crust
	* As islands are carried farther from the spreading axis due to plate motion, they sink below sea level as ocean crust cools and subsides

* Ocean atoll formation
	* Atolls form when the volcano sinks below sea level as ocean crust cools. 
	* Coral reefs continue to grow to sea level, producing an atoll ring
	* If coral dies, ...
