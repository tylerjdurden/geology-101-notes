## Geologic Time

* Principle of Biotic Succession
	* **Def:** Assemblages of fossils change regularly through a stratigraphic section and do not repeat, so each stratigraphic unit contains a unique set of fossils
	* The tool is limited to part of the geologic column

* Naming geologic time units
	* Similar to use in:
		* Archeology: Stone Age, Bronze Age, Iron Age
		* History: Pharonic Egypt, Classical Mediterranean, the Renaissance, etc

* Fossils
	* Changes in fossil assemblages used to subdivide geologic time

* Numerical Age Dating
	* Using radioactive decay of radiogenic isotopes
	* Process
		* Radioactive decay involves the change in atoms of an isotope of an element to an isotope of a different element
		* This is a **time-dependent process**.
	* Radioactive decay
		* Parent - an unstable radioactive isotope
		* Decay product - the isotopes resulting from the decay of a parent
		* Half-life - the time required for one-half of the radioactive nuclei in a sample to decay
	* Reliability of radiometric ages
		* Reliable dates depend on using samples that have not been altered
		* A closed system is required
			* No gain or loss of parent or decay product
		* Only fresh, unweathered rock samples should be used
