## Paleomagnetic Time Scale

* Plate tectonics
	* Plate boundaries
		* Interactions among individual plates occur along their boundaries
		* Types of plate boundaries
			* Divergent plate boundaries (constructive margins)
			* Convergent plate boundaries (destructive margins)
			* Transform plate boundaries (conservative margins)

* Divergent plate boundaries - in oceans
	* Seafloor spreading located on crests of oceanic ridges in ocean basins
	* Oceanic ridge are elevated due to high heat flow and have rift valleys on top
	* Ridge systems have topographic differences, controlled by spreading rates

* Process
	* Seafloor spreading is the result of plates moving away from ridge spreading axis and new ocean crust forming from magma (melted rock) to form ocean crust

* Mid-ocean ridges
	* Ridges along divergent plate boundaries that form because newly created oceanic lithosphere is hot and occupies more volumen that cooler rocks
		* High heat flow
		* Zone of volcanic activity
		* Have widths of 1000 to 4000 km - are broad, elongated swells
		* Axis of some ridge segments have down faulted structures called rift valleys
	* Spreading rates at ocean ridges
		* Slow (1-5 cm per year)
			* For prominent rift valley on ridge crest 30-50 km across and 1500 - 2000 m deep
		* Intermediate (5-9cm per year)
			* Rift valleys are shallow and less than 200 m deep
		* High (> 9 cm per year)
			* No median rift valley develops

* Structure of oceanic crust
	* Four distinct layers
		* Layer 1 - unconsolidated sediments
		* Layer 2 - zone of pillow lava
		* Layer 3 - numerous interconnected dikes called sheet dikes
		* Layer 4 - gabbro, in a sequence of rocks called an ophiolite complex

* Process
	* Ocean crust forms by extrusive volcanism and intrusions into lower layers, forming rock of different composition than mantle

* Hot water vents on ridges
	* Interactions between seawater and oceanic crust
		* Seawater circulates downward through the highly fractured crust
		* Basaltic rock is altered by hydrothermal metamorphism
		* Hydrothermal fluids dissolve ions of various metals and precipitate them on the seafloor as particle-filled clouds called black smokers

* Process
	* Hot water vents occur because ocean crust craccks as it cools and water seeps into lower levels where it is heated, then rises to surface as along fractures as hot water

* Divergent plate boundaries - in continents
	* Continental rifting
		* Splits landmasses into two or more smaller segments along a continental rift
		* Examples include the East African rift valleys and the Rhine Valley in northern Europe
		* Produced by extensional forces acting on lithospheric plates
