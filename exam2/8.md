## Igneous Rocks and magma

* General characteristics of magma
	* Igneous rocks form as molten rock (magma, lava) cools and solidifies
	* General characteristics of magma
		* Forms from partial melting of rocks
		* Magma at surface is called lava
	* Rocks formed from lava are exttrusive, or volcanic rocks
	* Rocks formed from magma ar depth are intrusive, or plutonic rocks
	* Magma consists of three components
		* Liquid portion = melt
		* Solids, if present = silicate materials
		* Volatiles = dissolved gases in the melt, including water vapor (H<sub>2</sub>O), carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), and sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>)
	* Crystallization of magma
		* Cooling of magma allows silicate minerals to crystallize in a predictable order

* Igneous compositions
	* Igneous rocks are composed mostly of silicate materials
		* Olivine, pyroxene, amphibole, feldspars, muscovite, biotite mica, quartz
	* Silica content is an indicator of composition
		* Crustal rocks range from 45% to 70% silica
	* Silica content influences magma behavior
		* Granite magmas = high silica content and viscous
		* Basaltic magmas = much lower silica content and more fluid-like behavior
