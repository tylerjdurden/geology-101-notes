## More Igneous Rocks

* Granite / Rhyolite
	* Granite
		* Light-colored silicates
		* Course grained
		* High amounts of silica (SiO<sub>2</sub>)
		* Over 25% quartz, about 65% feldspar
	* Rhyolite (fine-grained)
		* May be extrusive
		* Contain glass fragments and vesicles

* High silica composition
	* Obsidian (high silica rock)
		* Glassy texture
		* Usually dark colored
	* Pumice
		* Glassy texture
		* Frothy appearance with numerous voids
		* Produced during volcanic eruption

* Basalt composition
	* Basalt (low silica rock)
		* Dark silicates and calcium-rich feldspar
		* Termed mafic (**ma**gnesium and **fe**rric, for iron)
		* Composed mainly of pyroxene and calcium-rich plagioclase feldspar
		* Higher density than granitic rocks
		* Comprise the ocean floor and many volcanic islands
		* Most common extrusive igneous rock
		* Fine grained

* Gabbro composition
	* Gabbro (low silica rock)
		* Intrusive equivalent of basalt
		* Coarse grained
		* Consist of pyroxene and calcium-rich plagioclase
		* Significant % of oceanic crust

* Andesite-diorite compositions
	* Intermediate rocks
		* "This composes subduction zones!"
		* Andesite
			* Volcanic origin
			* Fine grained
		* Diorite
			* Plutonic equivalent of andesite
			* Coarse grained

* Ultramafic composition
	* Lowest silica
	* Composition high in magnesium and iron
	* Composed entirely of ferromagnesian silicates
	* Composed of silicate minerals, mostly olivine

* Volcanic ash (Pyroclasic rock)
	* Composed of fragments ejected during a volcanic eruption
	* Varieties
		* Tuff = ash-sized fragments
		* Colvanic breccia = particles larger than ash

* Pegmatite crystals
	* High water content of magma allows rapid crystallization of large crystals
	* Often leave open pockets where gem minerals crystallize
